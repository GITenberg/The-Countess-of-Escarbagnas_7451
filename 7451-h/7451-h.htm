<p>'La Comtesse d'Escarbagnas' was acted before the Court at Saint-Germain-en-Laye,
on December 2, 1671, and in the theatre of the Palais
Royal on July 8, 1672. It was never printed during Moli&egrave;re's lifetime,
but for the first time only in 1682. It gives us a good picture of the
provincial thoughts, manners, and habits of those days.</p>

<h2>THE COUNTESS OF ESCARBAGNAS.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>SCENE I.&mdash;JULIA, THE VISCOUNT.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>. What! you are here already?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
Yes, and you ought to be ashamed of yourself, Cl&eacute;ante; it is not
right for a lover to be the last to come to the rendezvous.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
I should have been here long ago if there were no importunate
people in the world. I was stopped on my way by an old bore of rank,
who asked me news of the court, merely to be able himself to detail to
me the most absurd things that can well be imagined about it. You know
that those great newsmongers are the curse of provincial towns, and
that they have no greater anxiety than to spread, everywhere abroad
all the tittle-tattle they pick up. This one showed me, to begin with,
two large sheets of paper full to the very brim with the greatest
imaginable amount of rubbish, which, he says, comes from the safest
quarters. Then, as if it were a wonderful thing, he read full length
and with great mystery all the stupid jokes in the Dutch Gazette,
which he takes for gospel.<a href="#fc1"><span class="small"><sup>1</sup></span></a>
He thinks that France is being brought to ruin by the pen of
that writer, whose fine wit, according to him, is sufficient to defeat
armies. After that he raved about the ministry, spoke of all its
faults, and I thought he would never have done. If one is to believe
him, he knows the secrets of the cabinet better than those who compose
it. The policy of the state is an open book to him, and no step is
taken without his seeing through it. He shows you the secret
machinations of all that takes place, whither the wisdom of our
neighbours tends, and controls at his will and pleasure all the
affairs of Europe. His knowledge of what goes on extends as far as
Africa and Asia, and he is informed of all that; is discussed in the
privy council of Prester John.<a href="#fc2"><span class="small"><sup>2</sup></span></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
You make the best excuse you can, and so arrange it that it may
pass off well and be easily received.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
I assure you, dear Julia, that this is the real reason of my
being late. But if I wanted to say anything gallant, I could tell you
that the rendezvous to which you bring me here might well excuse the
sluggishness of which you complain. To compel me to pay my addresses
to the lady of this house is certainly reason enough for me to fear
being here the first. I ought not to have to bear the misery of it,
except when she whom it amuses is present. I avoid finding myself
alone with that ridiculous countess with whom you shackle me. In
short, as I come only for your sake, I have every reason to stay away
until you are here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
Oh! you will never lack the power of giving a bright colour to
your faults. However, if you had come half an hour sooner, we should
have enjoyed those few moments. For when I came, I found that the
countess was out, and I have no doubt that she is gone all over the
town to claim for herself the honour of the comedy you gave me under
her name.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
But, pray, when will you put an end to this, and make me buy
less dearly the happiness of seeing you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
When our parents agree, which I scarcely dare hope for. You know
as well as I do that the dissensions which exist between our two
families deprive us of the possibility of seeing each other anywhere
else, and that neither my brothers nor my father are likely to approve
of our engagement.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
Yes; but why not profit better by the opportunity which their
enmity gives us, and why oblige me to waste, under a ridiculous
deception, the moments I pass near you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
It is the better to hide our love; and, besides, to tell you the
truth, this deception you speak of is to me a very amusing comedy, and
I hardly think that the one you give me to-day will amuse me as much.
Our Countess of Escarbagnas, with her perpetual infatuation for
"quality," is as good a personage as can be put on the stage. The
short journey she has made to Paris has brought her back to Angoul&ecirc;me
more crazy than ever. The air of the court has given a new charm to
her extravagance, and her folly grows and increases every day.</p>

<p class="noline"><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
Yes; but you do not take into consideration that what amuses you
drives me to despair; and that one cannot dissimulate long when one is
under the sway of love as true as that which I feel for you. It is
cruel to think, dear Julia, that this amusement of yours should
deprive me of the few moments during which I could speak to you of my
love, and last night I wrote on the subject some verses that I cannot
help repeating to you, so true is it that the mania of reciting one's
verses is inseparable from the title of a poet:</p>

<div class="center">
<table style="margin: 0 auto" summary="poem"><tr><td>

<p class="noindent">"Iris, too long thou keepst on torture's rack<br />

  One who obeys thy laws, yet whisp'ring chides<br />

  In that thou bidst me boast a joy I lack,<br />

  And hush the sorrow that my bosom hides.</p>

<p class="noindent">Must thy dear eyes, to which I yield my arms,<br />

  From my sad sighs draw wanton pleasure still?<br />

  Is't not enough to suffer for thy charms<br />

  That I must grieve at thy capricious will?</p>

<p class="noindent">This double martyrdom a pain affords<br />

  Too keen to bear at once; thy deeds, thy words,<br />

  Work on my wasting heart a cruel doom,</p>

<p class="noindent">Love bids it burn; constraint its life doth chill.<br />

  If pity soften not thy wayward will,<br />

  Love, feigned and real, will lead me to the tomb."</p>
</td></tr></table>
</div>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
I see that you make yourself out much more ill-used than you
need; but it is the way with you poets to tell falsehoods in cold
blood, and to pretend that those you love are much more cruel than
they are, in order to make them correspond to the fancies you may take
into your heads. Yet, I should like you, if you will, to give me those
verses in writing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
No, it is enough that I have repeated them to you, and I ought
to stop there. A man may be foolish enough to make verses, but that is
different from giving them to others.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
It is in vain for you to affect a false modesty; your wit is well
known, and I do not see why you should hide what you write.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
Ah! we must tread here with the greatest circumspection. It is a
dangerous thing to set up for a wit. There is inherent to it a certain
touch of absurdity which is catching, and we should be warned by the
example of some of our friends.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
Nonsense, Cl&eacute;ante; I see that, in spite of all you say, you are
longing to give me your verses; and I feel sure that you would be very
unhappy if I pretended not to care for them.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
I unhappy? Oh! dear no, I am not so much of a poet for you to
think that I &#8230; but here is the Countess of Escarbagnas; I'll go by
this door, so as not to meet her, and will see that everything is got
ready for the play I have promised you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE II.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA; ANDR&Eacute;E and CRIQUET <i>in the
background</i>.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
What, Madam, are you alone? Ah! what a shame! All alone! I
thought my people had told me that the Viscount was here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
It is true that he came, but it was sufficient for him to know
that you were not at home; he would not stop after that.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. What! did he see you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
And did he not stop to talk with you?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
No, Madam; he wished to show you how very much he is struck by
your charms.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Still, I shall call him to account for that. However much any
one may be in love with me, I wish them to pay to our sex the homage
that is due to it. I am not one of those unjust women who approve of
the rudeness their lovers display towards other fair ones.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
You must in no way be surprised at his conduct. The love he has
for you shows itself in all his actions, and prevents him from caring
for anybody but you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
I know that I can give rise to a strong passion; I have for that
enough of beauty, youth, and rank, thank Heaven; but it is no reason
why those who love me should not keep within the bounds of propriety
towards others. (<i>Seeing</i> CRIQUET.) What are you doing there,
little page? is there not an ante-room for you to be in until you are
called? It is a strange thing that in the provinces we cannot meet
with a servant who knows his place! To whom do you think I am
speaking? Why do you not move? Will you go outside, little knave that
you are!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE III.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Come hither, girl.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
What do you wish me to do, Ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
To take off my head-dress. Gently, you awkward girl: how roughly
you touch my head with your heavy hands!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I do it as gently as I can, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
No doubt; but what you call gently is very rough treatment for
my head. You have almost put my neck out of joint. Now, take also this
muff; go and put it with the rest into the closet; don't leave
anything about. Well! where is she going to now? What is the stupid
girl doing?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I am going to take this into the closet, as you told me, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Ah! heavens! (<i>To</i> JULIA) Pray, excuse her rudeness, Madam.
(<i>To</i> ANDR&Eacute;E) I told you my closet, great ass; that is the place
where I keep my dresses.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
Please, Ma'am, is a cupboard called a closet at court?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Yes, dunce; it is thus that a place where clothes are kept is
called.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I will remember it, Ma'am, as well as the word furniture
warehouse for your attic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IV.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
What trouble it gives me to have to teach such simpletons.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
I think them very fortunate to be under your discipline, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
She is my nurse's daughter, whom I have made lady's-maid; the
post is quite new to her, as yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
It shows a generous soul, Madam, and it is glorious thus to form
people.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Come, some seats, I say! Here, little page! little page! little
page-boy! Truly, this is too bad not to have a page to give us chairs!
My maids! my page! my page! my maids! Ho! somebody! I really think
that they must be all dead, and that we shall have to find seats for
ourselves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE V.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
What is it you want, Ma'am?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
You do make people scream after you, you servants!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I was putting your muff and head-dress away in the cup &#8230; in the
closet, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.Call in that rascal of a page.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I say, Criquet!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Cease that "Criquet" of yours, stupid, and call out "Page."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
Page then, and not Criquet, come and speak to missis. I think he
must be deaf. Criq&#8230;. Page! page!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VI.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E, CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. What is it you want?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Where were you, you rascal?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. In the street, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Why in the street?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. You told me to go outside.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
You are a rude little fellow, and you ought to know that outside
among people of quality, means the ante-room. Andr&eacute;e, mind you ask my
equerry to flog this little rogue. He is an incorrigible little
wretch.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
Whom do you mean by your equerry, Ma'am? Is it Mr. Charles you
call by that name?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Be silent, impertinent girl! You can hardly open your month
without making some rude remark. (<i>To</i> CRIQUET) Quick, some
seats; (<i>to</i> ANDR&Eacute;E) and you, light two wax candles in my silver
candlesticks; it is getting late. What is it now? why do you look so
scared?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>. Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Well&mdash;Ma'am&mdash;what is the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>. It is that &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I have no wax candles, but only dips.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
The simpleton! And where are the wax candles I bought a few days
ago?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>. I have seen none since I have been here.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Get out from my presence, rude girl. I will send you back to
your home again. Bring me a glass of water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS and JULIA (<i>making much ceremony before
they sit down</i>).</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Ah! Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Ah! Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Madam, I beg of you!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Madam, I beg of you!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Oh! Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Oh! Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Pray, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Pray, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Now really, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Now really, Madam!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
I am in my own house, Madam! We are agreed as to that. Do you
take me for a provincial, Madam?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. Oh! Heaven forbid, Madam!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE VIII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E (<i>who brings a glass of
water</i>), CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. (<i>to</i> ANDR&Eacute;E).
Get along with you, you hussy. I drink with
a salver. I tell you that you must go and fetch me a salver.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>. Criquet, what's a salver?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. A salver?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. (<i>to</i> ANDR&Eacute;E).
Will you move, or will you not?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
We don't either of us know what a salver is.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Know, then, that it is a plate on which you put the glass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE IX.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Long live Paris! It is only there that one is well waited upon;
there a glance is enough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE X.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E (<i>who brings a glass of water,
with a plate on the top of it</i>), CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Is that what I asked you for, dunderhead? It is under that you
must put the plate.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
That is easy to do. (<i>She breaks the glass in trying to put it
on the plate.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
You stupid girl! You shall really pay for the glass; you shall,
I promise you!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
Very well, Ma'am, I will pay you for it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
But did you ever see such an awkward loutish girl? such a &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">And</span>.
I say, Ma'am, if I am to pay for the glass, I won't be scolded
into the bargain.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Get out of my sight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XI.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Really, Madam, small towns are strange places. In them there is
no respect of persons, and I have just been making a few calls at
houses where they drove me almost to despair; so little regard did
they pay to my rank.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
Where could you expect them to have learnt manners? They have
never been to Paris.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Still, they might learn, if they would only listen to one; but
what I think too bad is that they will persist in saying that they
know as much as I do&mdash;I who have spent two months in Paris, and have
seen the whole court.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. What absurd people!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
They are unbearable in the impertinent equality with which they
treat people. For, in short, there ought to be a certain subordination
in things; and what puts me out of all patience is that a town
upstart, whether with two days' gentility to boast of or with two
hundred years', should have impudence enough to say that he is as much
of a gentleman as my late husband, who lived in the country, kept a
pack of hounds, and took the title of Count in all the deeds that he
signed.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
They know better how to live in Paris, in those large hotels you
must remember with such pleasure! That Hotel of Mouchy, Madam; that
Hotel of Lyons, that Hotel of Holland, what charming places to live
in!<a href="#fc3"><span class="small"><sup>3</sup></span></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
It is true that those places are very different from what we
have here. You see there people of quality who do not hesitate to show
you all the respect and consideration which you look for. One is not
under the obligation of rising from one's seat, and if one wants to
see a review or the great ballet of Psyche, your wishes are at once
attended to.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
I should think, Madam, that during your stay in Paris you made
many a conquest among the people of quality.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
You can readily believe, Madam, that of all the famous court
gallants not one failed to come to my door and pay his respects to me.
I keep in my casket some of the letters sent me, and can prove by them
what offers I have refused. There is no need for me to tell you their
names; you know what is meant by court gallants.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
I wonder, Madam, how, after all those great names, which I can
easily guess, you can descend to Mr. Thibaudier, a councillor, and Mr.
Harpin, a collector of taxes? The fall is great, I must say. For your
viscount, although nothing but a country viscount, is still a
viscount, and can take a journey to Paris if he has not been there
already. But a councillor and a tax-gatherer are but poor lovers for a
great countess like you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
They are men whom one treats kindly in the country, in order to
make use of when the need arises. They serve to fill up the gaps of
gallantry, and to swell the ranks of one's lovers. It is a good thing
not to leave a lover the sole master of one's heart, lest, for want of
rivals, his love go to sleep through over-confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
I confess, Madam, that no one can help profiting wonderfully by
all you say. Your conversation is a school, to which I do not fail to
come every day in order to learn something new.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E, CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. (<i>to the</i> COUNTESS).
Here is Jeannot, Mr. Thibaudier's man,
who wants to see you, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Ah! you little wretch, this is another of your stupidities. A
well-bred lackey would have spoken in a whisper to the gentlewoman in
attendance; the latter would have come to her mistress and have
whispered in her ear: "Here is the footman of Mr. So-and-so, who wants
to speak to you, Madam." To which the mistress would have answered,
"Show him in."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XIII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, ANDR&Eacute;E, CRIQUET, JEANNOT.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. Come along in, Jeannot.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Another blunder. (<i>To</i> JEANNOT) What do you want, page?
What have you there?</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smallcaps">Jean</span>.
It is Mr. Thibaudier, Ma'am, who wishes you good morning, and,
before he comes, sends you some pears out of his garden, with this
small note.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XIV.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, CRIQUET, JEANNOT.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. (<i>giving some money to</i> JEANNOT).
Here, my boy; here is
something for your trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jean</span>. Oh no, thank you, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Take it, I say.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jean</span>.
My master told me not take anything from you Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Never mind, take it all the same.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jean</span>. Excuse me, Ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>.
Take it, Jeannot. If you don't want it, you can give it me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Tell your master that I thank him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>.
(<i>to</i> JEANNOT, <i>who is going</i>). Give it to me, Jeannot.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jea</span>. Yes, you catch me.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. It was I who made you take it.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Jea</span>.
I should have taken it without your help.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
What pleases me in this Mr. Thibaudier is that he knows how to
behave with people of my quality, and that he is very respectful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XV.&mdash;THE VISCOUNT, THE COUNTESS, JULIA, CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
I come to tell you, Madam, that the theatricals will soon be
ready, and that we can go into the hall in a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Mind, I will have no crowd after me. (<i>To</i> CRIQUET) Tell
the porter not to let anybody come in.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
If so, Madam, I give up our theatricals. I could take no
interest in them unless the spectators are numerous. Believe me, if
you want to enjoy it thoroughly, tell your people to let the whole
town in.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Page, a seat. (<i>To the</i> VISCOUNT, <i>after he is
seated</i>) You have come just in time to accept a self-sacrifice I am
willing to make to you. Look, I have here a note from Mr. Thibaudier,
who sends me some pears. I give you leave to read it aloud; I have not
opened it yet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
(<i>after he has read the note to himself</i>). This note is
written in the most fashionable style, Madam, and is worthy of all
your attention. (<i>Reads aloud</i>) "Madam, I could not have made you
the present I send you if my garden did not bring me more fruit than
my love&#8230;."</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
You see clearly by this that nothing has taken place between us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
"The pears are not quite ripe yet, but they will all the better
match the hardness of your heart, the continued disdain of which
promises me nothing soft and sweet. Allow me, Madam, without risking
an enumeration of your charms, which would be endless, to conclude
with begging you to consider that I am as good a Christian as the
pears which I send you,<a href="#fc4"><span class="small"><sup>4</sup></span></a>
for I render good for evil; which is to say, to
explain myself more plainly, that I present you with good Christian
pears in return for the choke-pears which your cruelty makes me
swallow every day.<br />

<span class="ind20">Your unworthy slave,</span><br />

<span class="ind24">THIBAUDIER."</span><br />

Madam, this letter is worth keeping.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
There may be a few words in it that are not of the Academy, but
I observe in it a certain respect which pleases me greatly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
You are right, Madam, and even if the viscount were to take it
amiss, I should love a man who would write so to me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XVI.&mdash;MR. THIBAUDIER, THE VISCOUNT, THE COUNTESS, JULIA,
CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Come here, Mr. Thibaudier; do not be afraid of coming in. Your
note was well received, and so were your pears; and there is a lady
here who takes your part against your rival.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>.
I am much obliged to her, Madam, and if ever she has a lawsuit in
our court, she may be sure that I shall not forget the honour she does
me in making herself the advocate of my flame near your beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
You have no need of an advocate, Sir, and your cause has justice
on its side.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>.
This, nevertheless. Madam, the right has need of help, and I have
reason to apprehend the being supplanted by such a rival, and the
beguiling of the lady by the rank of the viscount.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
I had hopes before your note came, Sir, but now, I confess fears
for my love.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>.
Here are likewise a few little couplets which I have composed to
your honour and glory, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
Ah! I had no idea that Mr. Thibaudier was a poet; these few
little couplets will be my ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
He means two strophes. (<i>To</i> CRIQUET) Page, give a seat to
Mr. Thibaudier. (<i>Aside to</i> CRIQUET, <i>who brings a chair</i>) A
folding-chair, little animal!<a href="#fc5"><span class="small"><sup>5</sup></span></a>
Mr. Thibaudier, sit down there, and read your strophes to

I think it is a little too long; but a liberty may be taken to
express a noble thought.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>. I am undone by Mr. Thibaudier.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Do not make fun of it; for the verses are good although they are
country verses.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
I, Madam, make fun of it! Though he is my rival, I think his
verses admirable. I do not call them, like you, two strophes merely;
but two epigrams, as good as any of Martial's.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
What! Does Martial make verses? I thought he only made gloves.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>.
It is not that Martial, Madam, but an author who lived thirty or
forty years ago.<a href="#fc6"><span class="small"><sup>6</sup></span></a></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
Mr. Thibaudier has read the authors, as you see. But, Madam, we
shall see if my comedy, with its interludes and dances, will
counteract in your mind the progress which the two strophes have made.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
My son the Count must be one of the spectators, for he came this
morning from my country-seat, with his tutor, whom I see here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XVII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, THE VISCOUNT, MR. THIBAUDIER, MR.
BOBINET, CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Mr. Bobinet, I say, Mr. Bobinet, come forward.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
I give the good evening to all this honourable company. What does
Madam the Countess of Escarbagnas want of her humble servant Bobinet?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
At what time, Mr. Bobinet, did you leave Escarbagnas with the
Count my son?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
At a quarter to nine, my lady, according to your orders.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
How are my two other sons, the Marquis and the Commander?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
They are, Heaven be thanked, in perfect health.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Where is the Count?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>. In your beautiful room, with a recess in it, Madam.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. What is he doing, Mr. Bobinet?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
Madam, he is composing an essay upon one of the epistles of
Cicero, which I have just given him as a subject.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Call him in, Mr. Bobinet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>. Be it according to your command, Madam. (<i>Exit</i>)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XVIII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, THE VISCOUNT, MR. THIBAUDIER.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>. (<i>to the</i> COUNTESS).
That Mr. Bobinet, Madam, looks very
wise, and I think that he is a man of <i>esprit</i>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XIX.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, THE VISCOUNT, THE COUNT, MR. BOBINET,
MR. THIBAUDIER.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
Come, my Lord, show what progress you make under the good
precepts that are given you. Bow to the honourable company.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. (<i>showing</i> JULIA).
Come, Count, salute this lady; bow low
to the viscount; salute the councillor.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>.
I am delighted, Madam, that you should grant me the favour of
embracing his lordship. One cannot love the trunk without loving the
branches.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Goodness gracious, Mr. Thibaudier, what a comparison to use!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
Really, Madam, his lordship the count has perfect manners.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
This is a young gentleman who is thriving well.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>.
Who could have believed that your ladyship had so big a child.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Alas! when he was born, I was so young that I still played with
dolls.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Ju</span>. He is your brother and not your son.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Be very careful of his education, Mr. Bobinet.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
I shall never, Madam, neglect anything towards the cultivation of
the young plant which your goodness has entrusted to my care, and I
will try to inculcate in him the seeds of all the virtues.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Mr. Bobinet, just make him recite some choice piece from what
you teach him.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
Will your lordship repeat your lesson of yesterday morning?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.

  <i>Omne viro soli quod convenit esto virile,<br />

  <span class="ind5">Omne viri&#8230;.</span></i></p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Fie! Mr. Bobinet; what silly stuff is that you teach him?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
It is Latin, Madam, and the first rule of Jean Despaut&egrave;re.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Truly, that Jean Despaut&egrave;re is an impudent fellow, and I beg you
to teach my son more honest Latin than this is in future.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Bob</span>.
If you will allow him to say it all through, Madam, the gloss
will explain the meaning.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. There is no need; it explains itself sufficiently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XX.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, THE VISCOUNT, MR THIBAUDIER, THE
COUNT, MR. BOBINET, CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Cri</span>. The actors send me to tell you that they are ready.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Let us take our seats. (<i>Showing</i> JULIA.) Mr. Thibaudier,
take this lady under your care.</p>


<p class="noindent">CRIQUET <i>places all the chairs on one side of the stage. The</i>

COUNTESS, JULIA, <i>and the</i> VISCOUNT <i>sit down, and</i> MR.
THIBAUDIER
<i>sits down at the</i> COUNTESS'S <i>feet</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
It is important for you to observe that this comedy was made
only to unite the different pieces of music and dancing which compose
the entertainment, and that &#8230;</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>.
Ah! never mind, let us see it; we have enough good sense to
understand things.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>.
Begin then at once, and see that no troublesome intruder comes
to disturb our pleasure.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>The violins begin an overture.</i>)</p>

<h3>SCENE XXI.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, JULIA, THE VISCOUNT, THE COUNT, MR. HARPIN,
MR. THIBAUDIER, MR. BOBINET, CRIQUET.</h3>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. By George! This is fine, and I rejoice to see what I see.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. How! Mr. Receiver, what do you mean by this behaviour? Is it
right to come and interrupt a comedy in that fashion?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. By Jove, Madam, I am delighted at this adventure, and it shows me
what I ought to think of you, and what I ought to believe of the
assurances you gave me of the gift of your heart, and likewise of all
your oaths of fidelity.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. But, really, one should not come thus in the middle of a play
and disturb an actor who is speaking.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. Hah! zounds, the real comedy here is the one you are playing, and
I care little if I disturb you.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Really, you do not know what you are saying.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. Yes, d&mdash;&mdash; it, I know perfectly well; and &#8230;</p>

<p class="noindent">MR. BOBINET, <i>frightened, takes up the</i> COUNT, <i>and runs
away</i>; CRIQUET <i>follows him</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Fie, Sir! How wrong it is to swear in that fashion!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. Ah! 'sdeath! If there is anything bad here, it is not my
swearing, but your actions; and it would be much better for you to
swear by heaven and hell than to do what you do with the viscount.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>. I don't know, Sir, of what you have to complain; and if&#8230;.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. (<i>to the</i> VISCOUNT). I have nothing to say to you, Sir; you
do right to push your fortune; that is quite natural; I see nothing
strange in it, and I beg your pardon for interrupting your play. But
neither can you find it strange that I complain of her proceedings;
and we both have a right to do what we are doing.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>. I have nothing to say to that, and I do not know what cause of
complaint you can have against her ladyship the Countess of
Escarbagnas.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. When one suffers from jealousy, one does not give way to such
outbursts, but one comes peaceably to complain to the person beloved.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. I complain peaceably!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Yes; one does not come and shout on the stage what should be
said in private.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. I came purposely to complain on the stage. 'Sdeath! it is the
place that suits me best, and I should be glad if this were a real
theatre so that I might expose you more publicly.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Is there need for such an uproar because the viscount gives a
play in my honour? Just look at Mr. Thibaudier, who loves me; he acts
more respectfully than you do.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. Mr. Thibaudier does as he pleases; I don't know how far Mr.
Thibaudier has got with you, but Mr. Thibaudier is no example for me.
I don't like to pay the piper for other people to dance.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. But, Mr. Receiver, you don't consider what you are saying. Women
of rank are not treated thus, and those who hear you might believe
that something strange had taken place between us.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. Confound it all, Madam; let us cast aside all this foolery.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. What do you mean by foolery?</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. I mean that I do not think it strange that you should yield to
the viscount's merit; you are not the first woman in the world who
plays such a part, and who has a receiver of taxes of whom the love
and purse are betrayed for the first new comer who takes her fancy.
But do not think it extraordinary that I do not care to be the dupe of
an infidelity so common to coquettes of the period, and that I come
before good company to say that I break with you, and that I, the
receiver of taxes, will no more be taxed on your account.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. It is really wonderful how angry lovers have become the fashion!
We see nothing else anywhere. Come, come, Mr. Receiver, cast aside
your anger, and come and take a seat to see the play.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. I sit down? s'death! not I! (<i>Showing</i> MR. THIBAUDIER.) Look
for a fool at your feet, my lady Countess; I give you up to my lord
the viscount, and it is to him that I will send the letters I have
received from you. My scene is ended, my part is played. Good night to
all!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Thi</span>. We shall meet somewhere else, and I will show you that I am a man
of the sword as well as of the pen.</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Har</span>. Right, my good Mr. Thibaudier. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Coun</span>. Such insolence confounds me!</p>

<p><span class="smallcaps">Visc</span>. The jealous, Madam, are like those who lose their cause; they
have leave to say anything. Let us listen to the play now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>SCENE XXII.&mdash;THE COUNTESS, THE VISCOUNT, JULIA, MR. THIBAUDIER,

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
